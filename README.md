# üçÖüçÉ Tomato-Leaf-Disease-Detection

This project focuses on developing and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for tomato leaf disease classification. The goal was to train a deep learning model capable of distinguishing between nine different tomato leaf diseases and healthy leaves based on image data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and validation consists of high-resolution images of tomato leaves, categorized into the following classes:

- Healthy leaves
- Diseased leaves (9 categories):

  - Tomato Mosaic Virus
  - Target Spot
  - Bacterial Spot
  - Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
  - Late Blight
  - Leaf Mold
  - Early Blight
  - Spider Mites (Two-spotted Spider Mite)
  - Septoria Leaf Spot

The dataset is divided into:
- Training set: 8,000 images (800 per category)
- Validation set: 2,000 images (200 per category)
- Test set: 1,000 images (100 per category)

## Project Scope
1. CNN Model Development ‚Äì Designing and implementing a convolutional neural network for image classification.
2. Model Training & Optimization ‚Äì Training the model on the dataset and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
3. Testing & Prediction ‚Äì Validating the model‚Äôs ability to classify new images correctly.

## Used Technologies
- Python (TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas)
- Deep Learning (CNN-based architecture)
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Evaluation & Visualization
